* Installation
In order to use this game with a friend you will have to git clone the repository
#+begin_src sh
git clone git@github.com:italoaa/Black_Jackie.git
#+end_src

Then run
#+begin_src sh
cargo run
#+end_src

* Customization
** Port
This Game runs by default in port =6000= on localhost. This can be easily changed in the main.rs.
#+begin_quote
There are plans to make the port part of the arguments list
#+end_quote

* How to play
This uses Tcp to make all the connections so any Tcp client is good enough. I personally recommend [[http://netcat.sourceforge.net/][NetCat]] as it is widely known and using it is rather easy.
** Using NetCat
#+begin_src sh
nc host port
#+end_src
*** Example
This example is how to connect to the default port. When the server is running localy
#+begin_src sh
nc 127.0.0.1 6000
#+end_src
